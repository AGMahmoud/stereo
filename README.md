# Stereoscopy

This exercise is for learning all about stereoscopic depth maps, and, if it gets to it, scene reconstruction from multiple views.
The basic idea is that you have multiple views of the same scene, and you know where your cameras are relative to each other - using this
information, you can determine the depth (to within some error bound) of any point within the image. For this, the cameras must be
[calibrated](https://github.com/dmckinnon/calibration/blob/master/README.md) instrinsically, and extrinsically (meaning you know the
 rigid-body transformation from one camera to the other).
 
I won't be following any specific paper; rather, just bringing in the theory here and there where necessary. I'll try to explain as best
I can, but better than to read my explanations is to read the theory behind it. The dataset I'm working from is [here](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/3dreconstruction) - it's superb, it has a lot of high quality images of objects, and complete calibration data for each view. 
For displaying images, I'm using OpenCV; [here's how to install it on Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqpHIMdKfU&feature=youtu.be).

# Overview
To get a depth map - that is, an image that contains the depth of every point in a scene at each pixel - one needs at least two views, and calibrated cameras. 
The method is then to detect common elements between the two images (commonly called 'Features' - see the next section), and for those
common elements that can easily be found in both, use the knowledge we have about how the two cameras are situated with respect to 
where each spot is to figure out where it is in 3D space. To put this more clearly, let's say two cameras are both looking at my face 
from an angle slightly off center - one to the left, one to the right. They can both see my nose. Since we know the transform from one camera
to the other, and each camera can project a ray through where my nose is, we can compute the intersection of those rays to say that my
nose is a depth *d* from the cameras. Repeat for each point that can be detected in both images, interpolate for anything in between, 
and bam, there's your depth map. 

The following sections break this down into greater detail, and go over the major components of my code. 

# Feature Detection
I've written about [feature detection elsewhere](https://github.com/dmckinnon/stitch#feature-detection), but I'll go over it here too. "Features" can be a bit of a vague concept in computer vision, and it certainly was for me at the start. Just call some OpenCV function and magical dots appear on your image! But what are they? How do you get them? Why do we want them?

Features are basically identifiable parts of images. An image is an array of numbers. How do I know what is identifiable if I see it again in another image? How do I know what is important to track? A 'feature point' is this, and Feature Detection finds these points. These points are useful because we can find them again in the other image (see the paragraph below for a greater description of this). So we find a feature on a part of one image, and hopefully we can find the same feature in the other image. Using Feature Descriptors, the next section, we can compare features and know that we have found the same one. Multiple matched features then helps us in the later section Feature Matching, where we try to figure out how to go from one image to the other. If we have several feature points in one image, and have found the same in the other image, then we can figure out how the two images fit together ... and that, right there, is how panoramas work!


There are a lot of different types of features, based on how you look for them.

#### Some common types of features:

- FAST features
- SIFT features
- SURF features
- ORB features
- [Difference of Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_Gaussians) features
- [Determinant of hessian](https://milania.de/blog/Introduction_to_the_Hessian_feature_detector_for_finding_blobs_in_an_image) features 


There are plenty more. Some are simple, some are ... rather complex (read the wikipedia page for SIFT features, and enjoy). They each might find slightly different things, but in general, what 'feature detectors' aim to do is find points in an image that are sufficiently distinct that you can easily find that same feature again in another image - a future one, or the other of a stereo pair, for example. Features are distinct things like corners (of a table, of an eye, of a leaf, whatever), or edges, or points in the image where there is a lot of change in more than just one direction. To give an example of what is not a feature, think of a blank wall. Take a small part of it. Could you find that bit again on the wall? That exact bit? It's not very distinct, so you likely couldn't. Then take a picture of someone's face. If I gave you a small image snippet containing just a bit of the corner of an eye, you'd find where it fit very quickly. AIShack has a [rather good overview](http://aishack.in/tutorials/features/) of the general theory of features.

In [my other tutorial](https://github.com/dmckinnon/stitch) I used FAST features, also called FAST corners. If you want a quick overview, see my other tutorial or OpenCV's [Explanation of FAST](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_fast/py_fast.html). They worked excellently there because panorama images typically have a lot of things with sharp corners. However, here, FAST corners actually work really badly. Why?

Consider this: the images I'm using here are things like faces. Faces have a lot of smooth curves, and not many very sharp changes. Put them under a lot of soft lighting, and you lose many sharp corners. FAST features are few and far between here. So what shall we use, then?

The [Determinant of the Hessian](https://milania.de/blog/Introduction_to_the_Hessian_feature_detector_for_finding_blobs_in_an_image) is a good place to start. This detector is designed to find feature 'blobs', and not corners. As the link says, 
"So, what exactly is a blob in an image? It is a homogeneous area with roughly equal intensity values compared to the surrounding". What does this mean? An area of pixels all roughly the same shade, surrounded by pixels clearly not the same shade. Consider, say, a nose - one sees a dark blob up the nostril. All pixels would be roughly the same amount of dark, surrounded by lighter skin pixels. But a blob need not be a circle - rather, any region of relatively uniform intensity. 

A brief explanation for what the Determinant of Hessian detector is (since that article goes into the deeper details): the Hessian matrix is a matrix of second-order derivatives around a point (*x*, *y*). When you are looking at second derivatives in the 2 dimensional case, you're looking at the curvature of the function. As that, with this - we are considering the local curvative of a 3 dimensional function (a function in two variables). We need the Hessian matrix *H*, a directional vector *v* for the direction we care about, and a location (*x*, *y*), and compute *H* at this point in direction of *v* by *v*^T * *H* * *v*. The eigenvectors of this then describe the vectors of highest and lowest curvature. But high curvature describes edges, in an image! If both eigenvalues are large, then we have strong curvature in every direction, and likely have an interest patch. Recalling that the determinant of a matrix equates to the product of its eigenvalues; hence, if the determinant of the hessian matrix for a patch is large, both eigenvalues are large (probably) and we have strong curvature. Label this point a feature!

The full Determinant of Hessian detector is more detailed and nuanced than this; this is just a high level overview. 


# Feature Description and Matching
I've written about [feature description and matching elsewhere](https://github.com/dmckinnon/stitch#feature-description), but I'll go over it again. 

Your average image might have over a thousand features - this is quite a lot to process later, as you'll see. We don't need that many features to do figure out how the panorama fits together (100 feature points per image is more than enough). So we should remove some features. How do we know which ones to remove? We compute a 'score' for each feature, that measures how strong that feature is, and we get rid of all features below a certain score. A 'strong' feature here means a feature point that is really clear and distinct, and easy to find again. A 'weak' feature is one that is vague, and would easily be mismatched. 

Once again, there are many methods of scoring features, and one of the most famous is the Shi-Tomasi score, invented by Shi and Tomasi in 1994. Here is their [original paper](http://www.ai.mit.edu/courses/6.891/handouts/shi94good.pdf).

AI Shack has a [good article](http://aishack.in/tutorials/shitomasi-corner-detector/) on the Shi Tomasi score, but it relies on some [background knowledge](http://aishack.in/tutorials/harris-corner-detector/), or having read the previous articles linked at the bottom (they're short and easy and good).

Essentially, for a the feature point and a small patch surrounding it, a matrix called the [Jacobian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant) is computed. This is basically the two dimensional version of the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator). The way we compute this is documented [here](http://aishack.in/tutorials/harris-corner-detector/). Then, we compute the eigenvalues for this matrix. Since this is a two-by-two matrix (see the previous link), the eigenvalues are just the solutions to a simple quadratic equation. The Shi-Tomasi score, then, is simply the minimum eigenvalue. 

Why? Why does this work? Well, for a two-by-two jacobian matrix, the eigenvalues define how strong the gradient is in the direction of the two eigen__vectors__ of the matrix. Basically, how much change we have in each direction. For a good corner, you should have a sharp image gradient (difference in pixel intensity) in both directions, so the minimum eigenvalue won't be that small. For just an edge, you'll have a sharp gradient in one direction but not the other, meaning one eigenvalue will be small. 

We then have a cutoff threshold for this value - another tunable parameter - and everything with a score below this - that is to say, every feature with a minimal eigenvalue of value lower than this threshold - is thrown away and ignored. Every feature with a higher score is kept. 


The final stage of the feature scoring is to perform Non-Maximal Suppresion (and unfortunately I can't find a good explanation online). The theory of Non-Maximal Suppression is that for where you have a group of points clustered in an area, like having, say, twenty features of a good score in the same little patch of the image ... you don't need all of these. You've already registered a strong feature there. So you suppress, that is to say, put aside, the weaker features within some radius of the strongest in that patch. In other words, you suppress the points that aren't maximal. Hence, non-maximal suppression. 

So we do this over our feature set that we've already cut down. For every feature, if there are any features in a 5x5 patch around it that are weaker, we suppress these too, just to reduce the amount we have to process over.

I'm now going to start referring to these feature points we've been talking about as 'keypoints'. Because they are points that are key to matching the two images ... anyway. We now want to create keypoint descriptors, which are unique numbers for each keypoint/feature so that if we ever saw this again, we could easily identify it, or at least say "look, this one is very similar to that one, as their identifying numbers are close". This is what I mentioned before in Feature Detection. We found feature points in each image. Now we want to try to see which ones are the same, to find matching points in each image. How do we know if two features are actually referring to the same image patch? We need some distinct identifier - a descriptor. Each feature point will have its own descriptor, and when we try to figure out which of the first image's features are also seen in the second image, we try to see which features actually have the same descriptor, or very similar descriptors. This works because the descriptor is based on the patch of the image around the feature point - so if we see this again, it should register as the same. 

So, for now, how do we make these 'keypoint IDs'? What identifies a keypoint uniquely? Instead of saying ID, I'm going to use the word 'descriptor', because all the literature does that, but all that means is 'something that describes', and you can replace it with ID and you lose little. 
As always, there are many ways of making descriptors for keypoints. BRIEF descriptors, SURF descriptors ... different descriptors have different strengths and weaknesses, like robustness to various conditions, or small size but similar identifying power ... but here, because I wanted to learn them, I chose SIFT descriptors. This stands for the [Scale-Invariant Feature Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform). 

Once again, AI Shack has [quite a good description of SIFT descriptors](http://aishack.in/tutorials/sift-scale-invariant-feature-transform-features/) - in fact, a good description of the entire [SIFT feature detector](http://www.aishack.in/tutorials/sift-scale-invariant-feature-transform-introduction/) too. I encourage reading both (the second is the whole series, the first link is just the last page in the series. It's not a long series).


I'll attempt to write my own briefer description here. So what's unique about a feature? Well, the patch around and including it, up to a certain size. On an image of a face, the corner of an eye is pretty unique, if you get a decent-sized patch around it - a bit of eye, some crinkles if the face is smiling, etc. What makes these things unique? Or rather, how do we capture this uniqueness?

Once again, gradients. The change in intensity - going from mild skin (say. The skin could be darker, but this example works best on a really pale person), to the darker shadow of a crinkle, back to mild skin - can be measured best by the gradient of a line through that area. If we get a little patch over a face crinkle, then we could find a dominant gradient vector for that patch - pointing perpendicular to the crinkle since that's the direction of the greatest change (light to dark). This dominant gradient vector, both in angle and magnitude, can then be used to identify such a patch. 

Ok, so we can identify a little patch with one edge. But aren't features corners? So, let's do more patches. SIFT creates a 4x4 grid of patches, with the feature at the centre of it all. Each patch is 4x4 pixels (so 16x16 pixels total to scan over). We find the dominant gradient vector for each patch - the vector angles are bucketed into one of 8 buckets, just to simplify things - and then we list all these in sequence. This string of bits - magnitude, angle, magnitude, angle, etc, for 16 gradient vectors around the feature, is the unqiue descriptor that defines the feature. 

There are a couple of things worth mentioning. The angle of each gradient is taken relative to the angle of the feature (when we create the feature, we measure the angle of the gradient in a smaller patch centred on the feature), to make this descriptor rotationally invariant. Another thing is that all the magnitudes are normalised, capped at 0.2, and normalised again, so as to make the vector invariant to drastic illumination. This all means that if we look at the feature again from a different angle, or under mildly different lighting, we should still be able to uniquely match it to the original. 

All of this is explained with nice diagrams in the AI Shack link above. 

So far we have found features, cut out the ones we don't want, and then made unique descriptors, or IDs, for the remainder. What's next? Matching them! This is so that we know which parts of the first image are in the second image, and vice versa - basically, where do the images overlap and how do they overlap? Does a feature in a corner of image 1 match with a feature in the middle of image 2? Yes? Is that how the images should line up then? Feature Matching answers this question - which bits of the first image are in the second and where?

Now we have to get the features from the left image and features from the right image and ask "which of these are the same thing?" and then pair them up. There are some complicated ways to do this, that work fast and optimise certain scenarios (look up k-d trees, for example) but what I have done here is, by and large, pretty simple. I have two lists of features. For each feature in one list (I use the list from the left image), search through all features in the second list, and find the closest and second closest. 'Closest' here is defined by the norm of the vector difference between the descriptors. 

When we have found the closest and second closest right-image features for a particular left-image feature, we take the ratio of their distances to the left-image feature to compare them. If DistanceToClosestRightImageFeature / DistanceToSecondClosestRightImageFeature < 0.8, this is considered a strong enough match, and we store these matching left and right features together. What is this ratio test? This was developed by Lowe, who also invented SIFT. His reasoning was that for this match to be considered strong, the feature closest in the descriptor space must be the closest feature by a clear bound - that is, it stands out and is obviously the closest, and not like "oh, it's a tiny bit closer than this other one". Mathematically, the closest feature should be less than 80 percent of the next closest feature. 

# Fundamental Matrix, or Essential Matrix
Since we have a calibration, we're technically finding the [Essential matrix, but we can still find the Fundamental matrix](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~afb/classes/CS4495-Fall2013/slides/CS4495-09-TwoViews-2.pdf). These matrices are basically fancy names for "the 3D transform from one camera to another". If we have two cameras, *C_0* and *C_1*, situated at two points in space looking at the same thing, then there exists some rigid-body transform that takes coordinates in the frame of *C_0* and puts them into the frame of *C_1*. A rigid-body transform is basically a rotation and a translation - or a slide. You can imagine sitting two ye olde-timey cameras on a table, pointing at, say, a wall nearby. They might be at some angle to each other. Grab one, turn it a bit, then slide it, and bam, it's in exactly the same position as the other, facing the same way (assuming these are magical cameras that can move through each other). That's what this matrix does. The __Essential Matrix__ takes points projected from a calibrated camera to the projective plane for another calibrated camera (that is, you need the camera calibration matrix). The __Fundamental Matrix__ doesn't care about calibration, and takes points in the projective image plane for one camera to the projective image plane of the other camera. 

We compute this with an algorithm called the [8-Point Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-point_algorithm), designed by [Hartley](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/andrew/scs/cs/15-463/f07/proj_final/www/amichals/fundamental.pdf) ([Here's another way of framing it](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~wojtek/papers/pami-nals2.pdf)). 

This algorithm works in a very similar way to how we find a homography between the images, except that we have a different equation. If we have corresponding points *x* and *x'* and fundamental matrix *F* then these relate by *x**F**x'* = __0__. Using this constraint we can form a system of linear equations for each element of *F*. Then we use our old friend, [SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) to compute a result for *F*. Note that the points *x* and *x'* should be normalised to have zero mean and standard deviation of 1 (I think) to remove the possibility of numerical error. This can come from some points having values of 1000, or so, and others 0.1. An error of a half affects one point significantly more than the other, but shouldn't. 

Now, one extra thing to note here. For the data set I'm using, we get 3x4 projection matrices *P* that transform 2D homogeneous coordinates from the image, (*x*, *y*, 1) in normalised pixel space, to 3D homogenous coordinates in real-world space, (*X*, *Y*, *Z*, 1) - this is in the real world in the same coordinate system that the camera's location is in. 

What's up with this? How does this work? Well, basically *P* encodes all this data in one hit. We can write *P* = *K*[R|t] to say that *P* takes a homogeneous 3D vector, rotates and translates it (this is the R|t section), and then uses *K* to convert it to homgeneous 2D image coordinates. Hartley And Zisserman's supposedly magical book Multiple View Geometry does explain this on page 158, and the surrounding chapter, but my goodness that is a dense book. [Others do a better job](http://ksimek.github.io/2012/08/14/decompose/) of explaining, without the density. 


# Triangulation
Once we have the Fundamental Matrix or Essential Matric we can triangulate the points. So triangulation is basically the idea of we have several known points *P_i*, and an unknown point *X*, and we know where *X* is relative to each *P_i*, so we use that to figure out our best approximation for *X*. I have a couple of ideas for this algorithm, and I'm going to try those before reading the literature, to see if I can figure it out. 

#### First idea:
We know that *X* lies on a ray from *C_i*, being camera *i*, through the point *P_i* in the image *i*. So if we have two images, from cameras *C_0* and *C_1*, and we know the transform from camera 0 to camera 1 (which we are given at the start or can compute), then surely we can just equate these two rays to find the point of intersection?

Good guess, but no, I was wrong with this. They may not be perfectly equal (in an ideal world, they are, but this is obviously not ideal). So they may never have intersection. Next!


#### Second idea:
We can pick a starting point of a known depth *d* on the ray *X_i* from *C_i* and project this into some image *j* using the Fundamental matrix between images *i* and *j*. Then compare the projected patch from image *i* to the patch at that location in *j*. If they match, bam, *d* is your depth. If not, increase *d* by some small delta and repeat, continuing until you hit your maximum depth. The best matching patch is where you stop and say that's your depth. 

Trouble is, this is very computationally expensive, and unnecessary. There is a better way. 


#### Third idea:
Going back to the first idea, we have those two rays. What we can do is take the difference of those two rays ... and minimise it! Surely the point where the rays are closest is the best depth for *X*. So, get the equation for their difference, put this in terms of a vector of the depth parameters, and get the Jacobian. Equate to zero, solve, and bam we have our depth parameters. Use these. 
Now this may still not be the best way, but it's a decent method I thought of. 


#### Oops
Turns out I'm rather wrong. The usual Euclidean geometric principles I'm relying on don't actually apply in Projective Geometry. (why?)
Let's see what the actual literature says. 

Firstly, there is [Hartley and Sturm's original 1997 paper on triangulation](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hartley/Papers/triangulation/triangulation.pdf), which details several methods and presents an optimal one. This is complicated to explain here, but the crux is that instead of adjusting depth for minimisation, they realised that there are a pair of true points that the feature points are approximating. Let's adjust the feature points such that we minimise the distance between the feature points and the theoretical true points. Their formulation for this problem results in a 6-degree polynomial, which must be solved to find the minimum. The advantage of their algorithm is that it is closed form and requires no iteration. 

Then came [Kanatani's paper on triangulation](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.220.724&rep=rep1&type=pdf), which aimed to improve on Hartley and Sturm with an iterative algorithm. Kanatani's idea is based, instead of estimating the point we are trying to emulate, estimating the delta we need to add to our detected point to get to the expected point. The diference is that framing the problem in this way allows one to algebraically rework it into a pair of equations in *F*, *x* and *x'* that can easily be iterated on. 

Finally, [Peter Lindstrom improved on Kanatani's method](https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/384387.pdf) by designing a non-iterative quadratic solution that is faster than Hartley and Sturm, and more stable. Technically, it is iterative, but in two iterations it gets numerically close enough for reasonable precision and so Lindstrom just optimised two iterations into the one closed-form algorithm. I'll be honest - I don't really understand this algorithm yet. But I can code it, and that matters more. Can always learn the theory well later. It's based, again, on minimising the delta between the detected points and expected corresponding points, subject to the epipolar constraint. But this time, Lindstrom reworks this equation using [Lagrange Multipliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier) to show that we are projecting the detected points onto epipolar lines through the expected points, and from this we can create a quadratic that when solves gives the update that forms the delta to add to the detected points to get the expected points. If this doesn't make sense, that's fine - I don't get it either.  

# Disparity map
Once we've triangulated every matching pair of points, we can create a disparity map. BAsically an image where each pixel is the depth gotta add more here woo
